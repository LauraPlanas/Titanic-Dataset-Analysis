# Titanic Dataset Analysis
## Introduction
This project has been developed for an assignment on the subject "Tipologia i cicle de vida de les dades" from the Data Science Master's Degree on UOC (Open University of Catalonia). The goal is to analyse in depth a known dataset from Kaggle. In this case, I will analyze the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), available at Kaggle.

The asked information for this assigment can be found in the `pdf` folder. The assigment and the code is written in Catalan.

## Contributors
This project has been developed individually by Laura Planas Sim√≥n.

## Project structure
* `data/original`: original data downloaded directly from Kaggle.
* `data/processed`: data after the process applied in the code.
* `src/Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code of the project. Also used to generate the deliverable pdf for the assignment, so it contains some Latex commands.
* `pdf/Titanic.pdf`: generated pdf file from the Jupyter Notebook (via Latex) with the answers for the university assigment.
